<h2> Ladder Theory </h2>


<p class="break"> "The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step" </p>


<p> Although this sentiment is clichéd and now somewhat overstated, there is something intrinsic that is especially useful when you consider your mental health journey. In my experience there is not one cure-all. There is not one single miracle habit that you can form in order to drastically improve your mental health, no matter how long you stick at it. This is something I will constantly echo in this blog. 

</p>

<p> Another key aspect is that you do not need any single improvement to form significant progress; you only need help taking the very first step. I like to imagine it like this: imagine you are stuck in a hole from which you need to get out, and there is a ladder in front of you. The first few rungs on the ladder are high up and fairly spaced out, but the higher up the ladder you go the less space there is between rungs. The most important thing you need to do is get on the first rung, but it also happens to be the most difficult. 

</p>

<p> The fundamental question is: how do I get onto the first rung? This is where the theories of compounding habits and the ladder connect. In order to get onto the first rung, you need to use a variety of new habits in order to make small but effective progress. This is why I do not like people who act as though singular habits, such as meditation, will be fundamentally transformative. They can be, but often don’t yield the type of change they’re looking for, or need, or crave. 

</p>

<p> A combination of meditation, therapy, medication, cardio exercise, sauna/steam rooms, cold showers, good sleep and structured days could make it easier to get on that ladder and begin your journey. 

</p>

<p> When I first got into the idea of self-improvement, it was primarily to move away from a depressed and anxious state. I was obsessed with figuring out how my mind worked and what, if anything, could improve my mental state. It seemed impossible to even get onto the first rung of the ladder. Fast forward a couple of years and I had finally gotten myself onto the first rung. Firstly I had sought help and sought medication. I know medication causes guilt within people that believe they shouldn’t be reliant on a tablet to feel better, but medication is a perfectly good and reasonable way to transform your mind. See my entry about medication for more about this. I then sought help in therapy. The combination of both was extremely helpful. It was however, still a long drawn out process to feel even relatively normal, and I had to form additional habits to help get onto the first rung. But the point is that either of these habits alone would have only yielded slight results. Too many believe singular habits or forms of help will be enough. But the big realisation was that once I improved my mental health just enough to be helpful to myself, I was able to improve and get better exponentially quicker. 

</p>

<p> The aspect of being helpful to yourself is really important. Part of the problem with people I have helped in the past is just how badly they look out for themselves, or how easily they slip into bad habits. Depressed people find it difficult to help themselves. That is one of the biggest obstacles to getting better, and one that makes getting better seem like climbing a mountain, or out of a steep hole. But really, the ladder is there for all of us, and it’s achieving that first step that makes the rest of the steps easier and easier.

</p>

<p> A combination of help and habits, over a period of time, will probably not conjure a massive transformative change. The most important thing to keep in mind is that they do not need to. A combination of habits will produce small enough change to simply begin your journey up and out of the hole. It is neither a quick nor easy journey, and it might require a lot of effort for only a small amount of change. This runs contrary to what a lot of Internet self-help gurus claim, especially the ones peddling a singular cure-all, such as meditation or exercise. These are really helpful, don’t get me wrong, but always combine habits and always seek the first step instead of trying to climb the whole ladder. The first step leads to the second and the second is closer than the first.
